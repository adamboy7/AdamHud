# AdamHud
I was asked to help make a Team Fortress 2 custom hud, so this happened. The origional hud effort was abandoned, and I don't mind the stock hud so much. However, one thing that does bother me is that the chat box partially covers your health. Besides moving chat, not many other changes are planned, but you never know.
